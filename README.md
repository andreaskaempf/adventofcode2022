# Advent of Code 2022

My solutions for the Advent of Code 2022, 
see https://adventofcode.com/2022

* **Day 1** (Go): Find the maximum sum of newline-separated 
  groups of numbers. For part 2, find the sum of the top 3 (*easy*).

* **Day 2** (Go): Rock/Paper/Scissors simulation  (*easy*)

* **Day 3** (Go, Python): Sum up characters that are common in two halves of
  some strings (Part 1), and common to groups of 3 strings (Part 2) (*easy*)

* **Day 4** (Go): Given pairs of numeric ranges, in how many pairs is one range
  entirely contained within another (Part 1), and how many pairs overlap at 
  all (Part 2) (*easy*)

* **Day 5** (Go): Simulate execution of instructions to move crates from 
  one tower to another, one at a time (Part 1), or in groups (Part 2) (*easy*)

* **Day 6** (Go): Look for first block of 4 (Part 1) or 14 (Part 2) 
  non-repeating characters in a string.  (*easy*)

To compile and run a **Go** program
* Change into the directory with the program
* go build day01.go
* ./day01

To run a **Julia** program
* Change into the directory with the program
* julia day02.jl

To run a **Python** program
* Change into the directory with the program
* python day06.py
